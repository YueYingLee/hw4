1.The change inside increment_int_a will not change the variable a after the function call.
2. The change inside increment_intb will change the variable b after the function call.
3. They have different answers because a is an integer and it could only pass by value, so a remains 32 since the copy of the integer is passed. However, b is a list which could be pass by reference. Therefore, b will become [33] since the reference of the original list object is passed.
